Vexa is an API for **real-time meeting transcription** using **meeting bots** and direct **streaming from web/mobile apps**. It extracts knowledge from various platforms including:

- **Google Meet**
- **Zoom** (coming soon)
- **Microsoft Teams** (coming soon)

It serves as an **privacy-first**, **open source** alternative to `recall.ai`.

It focuses on doing one job well: **clean, private, real-time transcription under your control so you can safely build on top**.

## News (31 August 2025)

- **MCP server for agents (new microservice):** Full Vexa API access from any MCP-capable agent (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.). See `services/mcp`. Built with https://github.com/tadata-org/fastpi_mcp
- **Hallucination filtering:** Greatly reduced hallucinations in selected languages. Contributions welcome ‚Äî add phrases to `services/WhisperLive/hallucinations/` for your language.
- **Google Meet UI updates:** Bot adjusted to the latest Google Meet UI changes for reliable joining and capture.

## Build on Top. In Hours, Not Months

**Build powerful meeting assistants (like Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Fathom) for your startup, internal use, or custom integrations.**

The Vexa API provides powerful abstractions and a clear separation of concerns, enabling you to build sophisticated applications on top with a safe and enjoyable coding experience.

For instance, the **Vexa Example Client** (see [Projects Built with Vexa](BUILT-WITH-VEXA.md)) was built in just 3 hours of live coding with Cursor, showcasing the rapid development possible with Vexa.

Furthermore, with our **n8n integration** (see [Projects Built with Vexa](BUILT-WITH-VEXA.md) for examples), you can create incredibly complex workflows with no code, leveraging real-time transcription from Google Meet (with support for other platforms coming soon).
